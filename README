tappet
------

This program creates a TAP interface and, in server mode, waits for
connections; in client mode, it connects to the given server. Once
connected, the two instances exchange encrypted packets via UDP to
bridge between their respective TAP interfaces.

This program is in the public domain. Use at your own risk.
