tappet
------

This program attaches to a pre-configured TAP interface and establishes
an encrypted UDP tunnel between itself and another copy of the program
running on a remote host. Each instance must be given the public key of
the other, and both sides are given the same address:port; one listens,
the other sends.

On both hosts, as root:

    # ip tuntap add tappet0 mode tap user tappet
    # : any other network/bridge configuration :

Then on "server" host A, with address 192.0.2.34:

    $ tappet tappet0 192.0.2.34:1011 <public key of B>

And on "client" host B:

    $ tappet tappet0 192.0.2.34:1011 <public key of A>

All of these parameters are mandatory. Once started, the program runs
forever, and exchanges packets between the TAP fd and the UDP socket,
encrypting in one direction and decrypting in the other.

This program is in the public domain. Use at your own risk.
