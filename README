tappet
------

This program attaches to a pre-configured TAP interface and establishes
an encrypted UDP tunnel between itself and another copy of the program
running on another host. Each instance must have its own secret key and
the public key of the other side; and both sides must be given the same
address and port (one side asks, the other accepts).

***WARNING***

This code has not been audited. Everything about encryption and
security in this document may be untrue. Read the code and draw
your own conclusions.

***WARNING***

No attempt is made to obscure the size and timing of packets being sent
over the wire. Ethernet frames are encrypted as they are received, and
immediately forwarded to the other side. Encryption is deterministic,
with a shared secret derived from one side's secret key and the other
side's public key. There is no renegotiation of keys. In fact, there
is no negotiation at all.

See http://cr.yp.to/highspeed/naclcrypto-20090310.pdf for details about
the encryption. This program includes a copy of TweetNaCl, which is in
the public domain.

The encryption adds a constant 56 bytes of overhead to every ethernet
frame, which are themselves about 18 bytes larger than their payload.
The MTU of both TAP interfaces should therefore be set to at least 74
bytes less than the PMTU between the two ends of the tunnel. If there
are MTU problems, packets will mysteriously disappear. There is often
no good way to find the right MTU other than by experimentation.

Â» Usage

First, configure TAP interfaces on both hosts as root:

    # ip tuntap add tappet0 mode tap user tappet
    # : any other network/bridge configuration :

Generate keypairs on both hosts with tappet-keygen:

    $ ./tappet-keygen A

This will put the secret key into A.key and the public key into A.pub.
Run the equivalent command on B, then copy A.pub to B, and B.pub to A.

Then on the "server" host A, with address 192.0.2.34:

    $ tappet tappet0 ~/A.key ~/B.pub 192.0.2.34 1011 -l

Finally, on the "client" host B:

    $ tappet tappet0 ~/B.key ~/A.pub 192.0.2.34 1011

All of these parameters are mandatory. Once started, the program runs
forever, and exchanges packets between the TAP fd and the UDP socket,
encrypting in one direction and decrypting in the other.
