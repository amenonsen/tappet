tappet
------

This program attaches to a pre-configured TAP interface and establishes
an encrypted UDP tunnel between itself and another copy of the program
running on another host. Each instance must have the public key of the
other side, and its own keypair; and both sides must be given the same
address and port (one side asks, the other accepts).

First, configure TAP interfaces on both hosts as root:

    # ip tuntap add tappet0 mode tap user tappet
    # : any other network/bridge configuration :

Then on "server" host A, with address 192.0.2.34:

    $ tappet tappet0 ~/A.keys ~/B.pub 192.0.2.34 1011 -l

And on "client" host B:

    $ tappet tappet0 ~/B.keys ~/A.pub 192.0.2.34 1011

All of these parameters are mandatory. Once started, the program runs
forever, and exchanges packets between the TAP fd and the UDP socket,
encrypting in one direction and decrypting in the other.

This program is in the public domain. Use at your own risk.
